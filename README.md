FreeAppBlocker is a free app for web and app blocking. Its goal is to reduce distractions and help users concentrate on crucial tasks. All Android 5.0 and later versions support the app. It consumes very little battery life and system resources. It also provides a fix that many well-known apps that are comparable to it do not yet implement for split-view and minimized apps.

Users can add URLs to a block list or add programs from their installed list. Users can later activate or disable any app or website, even if it is on the list. Additionally, the app contains a feature called "Strict Mode" that prevents you from removing/disable websites or apps from the list until the timer you've specified expires. Even after a phone reset, this functionality remains functional. But you can still enable/add to the list even after you've enabled Strict Mode.

The app also has a few settings, mostly related to monetization, where users may choose to help the developer by enabling or disabling videos and ad banners. Other unspecified features include a contact support button, change logs, and more.
